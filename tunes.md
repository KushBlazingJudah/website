# Tunes

Nothing here is definitive and most sections here will never be complete.
However, you can take this as a guide for various genres, whatever's listed here
at any given point in time.

Generally, all of this is just albums I like in no particular order.

This page contains large amounts of CJK characters.
If you see tofu (boxes), you just don't have the fonts.

## Future Funk

I have a generally low view of the current state of Future Funk, which is a
shame because this is one of my favorite genres.
But nobody does it really well anymore, and those who did fell off in a bad way.
I dream of a resurgence of "good" Future Funk but I'm sure that my dreams will
be in vein.
