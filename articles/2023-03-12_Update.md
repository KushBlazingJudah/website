# March 2023 update

Hi, it's been a minute and that's mostly because I have been mostly focusing my
efforts elsewhere instead of maintaining this alias.
I never left completely and was still active when I wanted to be but this site
has been neglected long enough.
Happy New Year, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, *your regional variation goes
here*, I hate the daylight savings antichrist.

A couple things was done in the absence of updates and some are still in the
process of being done.

- Wrote [Localbooru](https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/localbooru), a hacked
  together monstrosity that serves as a, well, booru but on localhost.
  Supposed to interface well with
  [Boorumux](https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/boorumux), I'm working on that.
  Out of all software I've published, this is what I use the most nowadays.
- Forked FChannel. Public release: ~~Late Feburary~~ ~~Early March~~ eventually.
  I'm still working on it in private, and I'm on the fence about hosting my own
  instance due to certain illegal images being posted on my hardware, left there
  for me, the janny, to remove.
  I may write the code for free, but I don't think I want to clean up after you
  more than I already do.
  I will elaborate on my changes in the next paragraph.
- Hacked together [mc.sh](https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/mc.sh) to see if I
  could get Minecraft running at a reasonable framerate on my main computer, a
  damn 2016 Chromebook.
  It can, I got up to 25-30fps on 1.8.9. But I don't really want to play on it.

The FChannel fork is probably the only thing people care about here, and it's
the only thing I have anything of note to say about anyway to the remainder of
this post will be regarding the fork.

Roughly three months ago as of writing I forked FChannel privately and have been
hacking on it off and on ever since, continuing development and correcting many
wrongs I made during early contributions.
The fork focuses on cleanup and QoL features/fixes to the existing codebase for
the first release or two, and whatever else from there.
Nothing federation breaking for the first release, I guarantee that, except with
following, I did break that but not in a bad enough way.

Counting my changes in
[PR #74](https://github.com/FChannel0/FChannel-Server/pull/74), I have made 58
commits to date and have touched a huge portion of the codebase by now having
made roughly 6,000 additions and 6,000 deletions according to some very rough
`git diff <first commit goes here>.. | grep "^+" | wc -l` reports.
Here is a few highlights I would like to touch upon:

- A lot of dead code was removed
- A lot of code was drastically simplified or refactored to make more sense
- A lot of work was done on the HTML/CSS side of things, and the number of
  `style=` has dropped quite a bit
- Identifier/code system has been dropped in favor of a traditional
  username/password scheme
- Various performance enhancements, including the pgx patch which is in use at
  <https://usagi.reisen> which improves database query performance by
  **about 50%**
- Blotters, board/instance locking, no captcha if logged in, and some other QoL
  fixes that probably everyone wants

This kept me busy for... a while...

Some of this comes at a very understandable cost, and I'm sure you can guess at
least one of the items in this list from that above list:

- Many database tables have been dropped and are going to be dropped
  automatically
- Many columns have been removed because there is literally zero reference to
  any of them in the codebase
- I hope you didn't have any janitors because you need to set them up with an
  account again
- Probably more, the migration is really hacky because I'm used to what SQLite3
  provides me and not PostgreSQL.

What I'm trying to tell you is to take backups and don't be surprised if at
first you need to restore them because I literally have no clue what I'm doing.

I plan to release my changes but I'm terrible at deadlines it seems so I won't
give a solid date, but it will happen, I will release the code.
I can't even run an instance right now anyway because I would violate the
AGPLv3 by doing so.
I would like to say late March early April, but you shouldn't be surprised if I
don't release it then; I want to release something that people can use and trust
to work at least ~~75%~~ 95% of the time and I'd rather delay the release than
release something half broken.

But it's there.

Other than that, life's good, and I'm going to be very busy in two months.

That's all I have to say, see you whenever I return.
