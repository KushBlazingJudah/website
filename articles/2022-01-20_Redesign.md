# Redesign
I've completely trashed the old layout of my site and decided to start anew.
This one is *mostly* written in Markdown and automatically generated with a
simple script that utilizes Lowdown.

Said script is like the fantastic `ssg5` but not fantastic.

For those who liked the old business card index page, it is now gone.
I miss it myself, it may come back if I decide to port it to the new layout but
it will stay like this for the time being.
