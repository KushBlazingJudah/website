title: Kobo Libra 2: Initial Impressions

# 2022-02-03: Initial Impressions of the Kobo Libra 2
Today, my package has arrived to save me from my now dead Kobo WiFi, which,
although hasn't been serving me long, has had it rough since day one.
It isn't new after all, from 2011.

My first thoughts were on how much more lightweight the Libra 2 was compared to
the Kobo WiFi.
It wasn't much, but the Libra certainly would pack more of a punch.

Secondly was the display, the Libra 2's display is obviously slightly bigger than
the WiFi's.
The Libra's display was 7" diagonally, the WiFi's 6".
The resolution was also heavily increased which was always a qualm of mine for
the WiFi, but this was also early e-ink technology.

Then I had to set it up.

Unfortunately, the Libra 2 requires you to install a program on your computer in
order to set it up.
This app probably doesn't support Linux, I don't really care anyway.
I wanted to avoid it at all costs.
Even though you needed an account, I wasn't going to use one.

I had previously heard words that this was soon to change with the introduction
of "Sideload Mode" but either it hasn't shipped yet or my device didn't have the
firmware.

But, it wanted me to connect to the computer and use programs on the computer so
there's quite obviously a way in.
The Kobo WiFi exposes a partitionless disk over USB, let's see if this holds
true for the Libra:

```
$ lsblk
NAME          MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS
sda             8:0    1  28.5G  0 disk  
```

I see this hasn't changed since the WiFi.
Continuing on.

I mounted the disk, and started exploring.
Everything is in hidden directories, of course.
I kept a copy of those for myself in case I needed to reset.

Peeking through `.kobo` I find some sqlite databases:

```
$ ls .kobo
Kobo/
certificates/
dict/
kepub/
slideshow/
BookReader.sqlite
KoboReader.sqlite
device.salt.conf
version
```

Let's open up `KoboReader.sqlite`, this is probably where the goodies are at.

```
$ sqlite3 KoboReader.sqlite
SQLite version 3.37.2 2022-01-06 13:25:41
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .schema
... lots of text ...
CREATE TABLE user(UserID TEXT NOT NULL,UserKey TEXT NOT NULL,UserDisplayName TEXT,UserEmail TEXT,___DeviceID TEXT,FacebookAuthToken TEXT,HasMadePurchase BIT DEFAULT FALSE, IsOneStoreAccount BIT DEFAULT FALSE, IsChildAccount BIT DEFAULT FALSE, RefreshToken TEXT, AuthToken TEXT, AuthType TEXT, Loyalty BLOB, IsLibraryMigrated BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT true, SyncContinuationToken TEXT, Subscription INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, LibrarySyncType TEXT, LibrarySyncTime TEXT, SyncTokenAppVersion TEXT, Storefront TEXT, NewUserPromoCurrency TEXT, NewUserPromoValue REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT -1.0, KoboAccessToken TEXT, KoboAccessTokenExpiry TEXT, AnnotationsSyncToken TEXT, PrivacyPermissions BLOB, AnnotationsMigrated BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT false,PRIMARY KEY (UserID));
... more text omitted ...
```

Oh, nice.
Here is the same thing, formatted:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user(
  UserID TEXT NOT NULL,
  UserKey TEXT NOT NULL,
  UserDisplayName TEXT,
  UserEmail TEXT,
  ___DeviceID TEXT,
  FacebookAuthToken TEXT,
  HasMadePurchase BIT DEFAULT FALSE,
  IsOneStoreAccount BIT DEFAULT FALSE,
  IsChildAccount BIT DEFAULT FALSE,
  RefreshToken TEXT,
  AuthToken TEXT,
  AuthType TEXT,
  Loyalty BLOB,
  IsLibraryMigrated BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  SyncContinuationToken TEXT,
  Subscription INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  LibrarySyncType TEXT,
  LibrarySyncTime TEXT,
  SyncTokenAppVersion TEXT,
  Storefront TEXT,
  NewUserPromoCurrency TEXT,
  NewUserPromoValue REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT -1.0,
  KoboAccessToken TEXT,
  KoboAccessTokenExpiry TEXT,
  AnnotationsSyncToken TEXT,
  PrivacyPermissions BLOB,
  AnnotationsMigrated BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  PRIMARY KEY (UserID)
);
```

What all do we need to fill in, anyway?
A few of these are `NOT NULL`s and therefore mandatory (excluding the ones with
default values).
I will assume I only need to fill in these.

```
INSERT INTO user(UserID, UserKey, HasMadePurchase) VALUES ("WSJ", "WSJ", true);
```

*A note from the future:*
`HasMadePurchase` suppresses some footers and nothing else.
I set it, with a couple of other options, in hopes that the footers would be
suppressed to no avail.
You can actually *almost* suppress these by enabling parental controls in
Accounts, which does nothing other than force WiFi off and disable the store it
seems.
The footers becomes just one and it only will ever give you information on how
to use the device.

I inserted this user into the database, I unmounted `/dev/sda`, I ran `sync` and
I disconnected it, and waited.

I'm in.

So, what now?

First thing I did was poke around in the settings.
Cranked the privacy settings as much as I could, but there wasn't much to crank.

I then connected the Libra back to my computer to peek around, and found
something I wasn't exactly happy to see: Google Analytics.

But, I also didn't have root, however that was relatively easy to get since Kobo
devices tend to be friendly to hackers and this is no exception.
I was going to install Koreader so I followed the instructions from there, and
then, I had root.
This was a rather quick and easy process.

I used Koreader to setup an SSH server, started a hotspot on my phone which had
no mobile data, and connected them together.

```
[root@kobo ~]#
```

Nice.

```
[root@kobo ~]# echo "127.0.0.1 www.google-analytics.com ssl.google-analytics.com google-analytics.com" | tee -a /etc/hosts
```

There's probably more to be done but I feel much better now about connecting
this to the Internet.

This is all for now, I will come back in the future.

# 2022-02-20: Two weeks later

I've had this for roughly two weeks now and I'll say, this is a quite solid
device.

I initially planned to use Koreader but I had found the interface somewhat
unintuitive, however this does not mean that the software is bad.
In fact, it is somewhat solid.
I had some problems with Cyrillic script, and I think Japanese too, but at the
end of the day, it did just work.
However, I prefer the factory interface, Nickel, which doesn't have this program
for Cyrillic and Japanese support is one pre-installed font away.

This device also hasn't been connected to the Internet asides from a handful of
times and I don't see the need to connect it to the Internet anyway.

One thing that I hugely enjoy is the increased resolution and bit depth, this
makes reading manga really enjoyable.
I prefer reading it on this than anywhere else.
Of course, paper is better, but this is as close as I'll get to paper and I'm
perfectly fine with that because it feels good, looks good, reads good and is
very easy on the eyes.

A minute detail, but not a huge fan of the power button, seems rather squishy
and I'm kinda worried about breaking it for some reason.

Overall, damn good device for reading when books are less convenient or
unobtanium.
I hope this serves me well into the future.
