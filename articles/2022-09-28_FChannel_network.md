# Current FChannel network

**Current as of 2022-10-22.**
I will update this periodically (about every month provided I remember), contact
me if a link here dies or you started an instance.
This is here as the official instance list is gone.

**New!** See this list in [JSON format](/fchan.json).
This goes through Tor, so all instances with
`unknown error general SOCKS server failure` are unreachable for one reason or
another.

All links unless otherwise noted are
[FChannel](https://github.com/FChannel0/FChannel-Server) instances.
`.onion` links need the Tor Browser to access.

### Recent Deaths

These instances died not too long ago. (<3 months, maybe)

- `https://chan.cum.salon`: Welcome to nginx!
- `https://chan.getgle.org`: Redirects to some business consultancy site
- `https://penchan.xyz`: Owner closed it, ~~says something else is coming soon~~
  Now a Plemora instance at `freecumextremist.com`
- `https://poopchan.org`: Fatal TLS error, assuming dead
- `http://kyogi7dxn3mr6a7eabaqh3jnxbbqbhty46aqstuhmqmokcxgr4vnbpid.onion`:
  Listed here because all connections failed during latest update.

## What happened to fchan.xyz?

I don't know, I don't think anybody knows.
The developer has been silent on this issue but still occasionally does
something on the GitHub repository.

It sucks for the network as that had the largest congregation of people, since
it had the advantage of being the instance.
Judging by the activity across the network, nobody moved elsewhere.

## What can I do?

If you have the time and resources, more instances of FChannel would be greatly
appreciated; I hope the network does not completely die.

If you don't have either, feel free to tell people about it.
