# Current FChannel network

**Current as of 2022-09-28.**
I will update this periodically (about every month provided I remember), contact
me if a link here dies or you started an instance.
This is here as the official instance list is gone.

All links unless otherwise noted are
[FChannel](https://github.com/FChannel0/FChannel-Server) instances.
`.onion` links need the Tor Browser to access.

## Alive

- <http://kyogi7dxn3mr6a7eabaqh3jnxbbqbhty46aqstuhmqmokcxgr4vnbpid.onion>
  - Seems overrun with spam

### [Feditext](https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/feditext) instances

## Dead

- `https://0x00000000.xyz`: Connection timed out
- `https://2hu-ch.org`: now some chat website
- `https://bbs.killthepresident.club`: Owner didn't have the time to moderate
- `https://chan.clubcyberia.co`: 502 Bad Gateway
- `https://fchan.xyz`: Connection timed out
- `https://fedorachan.vip`
- `https://fitchan.xyz`

### Recent Deaths

These instances died not too long ago. (<3 months, maybe)

- `https://chan.cum.salon`: Welcome to nginx!
- `https://chan.getgle.org`: Redirects to some business consultancy site
- `https://penchan.xyz`: Owner closed it, says something else is coming soon
- `https://poopchan.org`: Fatal TLS error, assuming dead

## What happened to fchan.xyz?

I don't know, I don't think anybody knows.
The developer has been silent on this issue but still occasionally does
something on the GitHub repository.

It sucks for the network as that had the largest congregation of people, since
it had the advantage of being the instance.
Judging by the activity across the network, nobody moved elsewhere.

## What can I do?

If you have the time and resources, more instances of FChannel would be greatly
appreciated; I hope the network does not completely die.

If you don't have either, feel free to tell people about it.
