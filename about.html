      <p>
        Hi, I go by WeedSmokingJew online.
        In the summer, I fish lobster and crab.
        I also play games and program on my time off.
      </p>

      <p>
        I run Linux full-time on most of my computers and try to be privacy-centric when possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Where do you live?</h2>
      <img src="/media/landscape.jpg" alt="A picture of a spot somewhat close to where I live."/>
      Somewhere near here. Nova Scotia, Canada.

      <h2>What languages do you know?</h2>
      <p>
        I have a goodish grasp on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go
            <ul>
              <li>This is largely my language of choice.</li>
              <li>Sometimes I wish I never learnt it, sometimes I'm glad I did.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>POSIX sh
            <ul>
              <li>
                Fun fact: I wrote three package managers using <i>exclusively</i> POSIX utils and sh.
                Source for my latest one is available <a href="https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/slpm">here</a>.
                Source for others were lost to time but some of their ideas live on in <code>slpm</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Python</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I know a thing or two about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lua (mostly in version 5.1)
            <ul>
              <li>I would like to thank a Minecraft mod for this. I have spent too much time playing with <a href="http://www.computercraft.info/">ComputerCraft (HTTP)</a>,
                  a mod which allows you to do computing inside of Minecraft and you can program with Lua 5.1.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>JavaScript
            <ul>
              <li>Once upon a time, I wrote a lot of code inside of JavaScript. I strongly dislike it now.</li>
              <li>Due to the above reasons, I can almost guarantee you there will never be one line of JavaScript ever written on these pages.</li>
              <li>That isn't to say that I don't remember a thing or two. I can navigate the language if I got a reference or a search engine readily available.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Docker
            <ul>
              <li>I'm by no means a huge fan of it, but sometimes it is very useful.</li>
              <li>Especially when you want something that comes (largely) preconfigured, it's nice to <code>docker run --rm -it debian:10-slim</code> when you need a Debian system.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I have largely forgotten:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java (first language)</li>
        <li>C# (don't use Windows anymore)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I am learning:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rust</li>
        <li>C</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Have you worked on anything of note?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>No.</strong> Not yet, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I do manage <a href="https://discord.gg/YfBUDU7GYn">a Discord server for beginner programmers</a>.
        This came to life some point on December 11th, 2020 and was made public shortly after on /g/'s /bpg/ thread which was the entire reason for the server existing in the first place.
        It also exists on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!iCmyhLwtzepRiZOYSh:matrix.org?via=matrix.org">Matrix</a> (enable spaces) and IRC (<code>/list #/g/bpg*</code> on Rizon).
      </p>

      <h2>What are your thoughts on <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>, and <i>Z</i>?</h2>
      <p>
        They don't really matter to you, but <a href="/thoughts.html">they're here if you really care</a> (you don't)
      </p>

      <h2>Is it okay to contact you?</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to, go for it. Use PGP if you use email, use Matrix for instant messaging but if isn't an option for you Discord is there for a reason, and I have ZNC logged into WSJ on Rizon so there's always that too.
