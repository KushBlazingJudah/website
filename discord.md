title: Discord FAQ

# Hello, Discordian!

[Go to the rest of my website.](/)
There isn't much here but if you want to look through it for some godawful
reason you can.

## Notice

**This document is obsolete.**
It remains here for future reference and serves no use currently; my apologies
if you got here by accident.
I no longer use this setup and instead will now use the official Discord client
under the same account my alt would've been on.

Development of any of the software I've used seems to have more or less stalled
and it doesn't work properly in some fashion; I'm looking into writing a
replacement myself but taking on a project like this is not at the top of my
work queue.

## Original content

I've gotten asked a handful of times on why I use Discord like I do, so here's a
quick explainer:

- I own WeedSmokingJew#7933 and numerous alt accounts, some of which have been
  permanently disabled.
- My alt accounts do not use the official Discord client, and that is the sole
  purpose why I have several permanently disabled accounts.
- If you want to prove it's me, ask me to sign a message with my
  [public key](/key.asc) or alternatively use literally any other form of
  communication listed [here](/#contact).
- The alt you talk to isn't guaranteed to be here tomorrow.
  [Remember what I'm doing.](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=L397TWLwrUU)
- I have to use my alts in a very specific way or else or that alt will be
  sacrificed to the Church of Discord, and I will be forced to make a new one.

## So what do you do differently?

I cannot start PM chats (but can still send PMs), join servers, leave servers,
reply, see replies, see roles, see reactions, react, respond to friend requests,
remove friends, and probably more.

Most of these are unsupported, the rest put my account in grave danger of being
permanently disabled.

If you do anything trying to be friendly and something that you'd normally
expect me to do the same, and it's listed up here, I literally cannot.

## Why?

Discord's web client sucks, simple as.
WeeChat also doesn't upsell Nitro to me.

Long story version: Spent some time in a place where the only connection to the
Internet I had was a severely limited 60kbps link for two weeks.
Wanted to talk to some netfrens of mine so I SSH'd into my server, painstakingly
setup BitlBee and (at the time) bitlbee-discord, joined my favorite servers
after waiting several minutes for Discord to load, and never looked back.

You are probably talking to me during the time I have a symmetrical 1gbit fiber
link.
I could very easily use Discord, but why would I leave the comfort of WeeChat
for the pain of being upsold Nitro at every opportunity and having to fix my
CSS every couple updates.

## Can I do this too?

Sure.
I personally use [purple-discord](https://github.com/eionrobb/purple-discord)
and [BitlBee](https://www.bitlbee.org) to talk on Discord from the comfort of
IRC.

However, there are several alternatives available, such as
[Ripcord (CLOSED SOURCE)](https://cancel.fm/ripcord/),
[weechat-discord](https://github.com/terminal-discord/weechat-discord), or 
[rdircd](https://github.com/mk-fg/reliable-discord-client-irc-daemon).

I cannot vouch for any of these, however I do condone breaking Discord's shitty
ToS.
Just use an account you don't care about and you'll be fine.
