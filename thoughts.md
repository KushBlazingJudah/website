title: Thoughts and views
desc: They don't matter that much.

# Thoughts

Once upon a time, this was just a complete mess and all in all rather useless.
It existed to exist, and exist was the only thing it did.
Nothing changed on that end, but the content was changed to be more composed.

## Politics

People care too much about politics these days; there's little reason to fret
over international events, or even most national events for that matter, save a
few here and there.
The only time I really care about politics is when it affects me quite a bit, or
when I can actually make a difference in how something plays out.
I don't really care about political things I don't have a choice in as a result.
I'd rather put my energy into better things than pointless political discourse.

I guess you could call my view "the grillpill", referring to an Internet image
macro involving [this
guy](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/556/116/4fb.png),
featuring words to live by: "I just want to grill for God's sake."

Of course, I still have my political views and biases which definitely come to
play in some portions of everyday conversation and even here, but this isn't
important to my point here.

## Technology

The current state of technology is simultaneously abysmal yet great.
Computers get faster by the day, entire libraries now fit in your pocket,
communication at literally the speed of light, yet what we currently do with
these technologies disappoints me to no end.

The hardware is great and keeps getting better but there's a huge infestation of
black box firmware, commonly called "blobs."
It's impossible to know what goes on in it other than that it makes your
hardware work and near impossible to make a replacement.
Many have tried, few have been really successful.

*Free software* is the concept of publishing your software under licenses that
emphasize freedom to the users; one can use software for any purpose and freely
modify it to fit one's needs.
It's something I wholly agree with, and most of everything I develop that is
remotely useful is published under a free software license.
I try to use as much free software as possible, which is pretty easy on Linux,
but not great on the hardware side because of these black boxes; it's a real
shame it's near impossible to get something 100% free as in freedom straight
from the factory.

### The Internet

I hold a low opinion on the current state of the Internet, and believe that the
only way to fix it is to burn it to the ground and start anew.
Alas, that's not gonna happen anytime soon, so for now I use the Internet in ways
that align best with my views of it.

On the graphical side, web browsers really suck.
They're big, complex, a complete mess and full of bugs, yet everyone relies on
them.
I design my websites to be perfectly viewable in a text-mode browser, with the
exception of Boorumux which is extremely graphical because it's literally made
to browse images.

On the technical side, I am a firm believer in that federation solves a lot of
issues we have with centralization, and for the most part we've been doing that
quite well.
We don't have as much adoption as I wish we would, but we're still doing pretty
damn good considering.
However the backing protocol for most of these federated platforms save e-mail,
ActivityPub, kinda sucks to work with.
I try to work with it as best as I can, but at times it's just headache inducing
because what may be completely valid ActivityPub is not accepted by one but
works fine on another.

The software side of things in general has a problem with needless complexity.
A lot of people write JavaScript, not a lot of the code is great, and then they
add a whole web browser on top of that because using the native toolkit is too
hard and ship it.
I'm not saying my projects that use web browsers aren't any better, but they're
written to try and be better than most, something they may achieve but probably
don't.

### Programming

When programming, I try to keep both the KISS and UNIX philosophies in mind; I
may not use the UNIX philosophy as much but KISS is important as it allows
people who are not me to work on the codebase.
I try to have as few interdependent parts as possible, however inevitably some
sneak in; but having as few as possible eases testing, whenever I write tests.

Additionally, it is important that I write software that is fast, especially on
slow machines or networks.
I have a gigabit fiber link with low latency but I want everything to work on
1/1000 of the speed just fine too.
Most of the server-oriented software I've written targets a budget of $0 and the
restraints of a Raspberry Pi, and it seems like I've done an okay job of this so
far because all of it does run on the Raspberry Pi and even things spec'd lower
perfectly fine.

## Music

I listen to a sad amount of music, and hoard an even sadder amount, so as a
result I have rather specific music tastes and views on certain aspects of music
and the culture surrounding it.
Bear with me...

Mainstream pop music is really bland, it all sounds the same.
Same old autotune, same old themes, same old beat, same old
overuse of `808_Closed_Hi-hat.wav` same old celebrities living their fake lives
through the lens of their phone camera, same old...
Why can't we change it up once in a while?
Sure, the sound has evolved, but **everything still sounds the same.**
I guess that comes with appeasing the masses, so nobody experiments and just
goes along with the status quo that seldom changes in a major way.
But the same would probably also have been said about pop music just a mere 20 years
ago, which is arguably better than pop music of 10 years ago.

As a result, I mostly toss away mainstream music and go for something that
hasn't been played a hundred times over on the radio; occasionally the
`alternative` tag brings me joy, and it's largely how I got to where I'm at now.

I owe a lot of thanks to vaporwave and the thousands of related sub-genres.
I might've just ripped on pop music for being lazy when the formula of
"classical" vaporwave is to just slow it down and drown samples in reverb and
echo, but through this I met cool people, discovered genres that I otherwise
wouldn't have, and for a brief period learned a couple things about sound.

## Society

We live in one.

Oh, and I don't like the current state of it in the West, where I am situated.
