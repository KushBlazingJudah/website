    <article>
      <p>
        This is just a non-exhaustive list of my views. It is in no particular order.
        These focus on mostly technology and were written in the middle of the night a while ago.
        It may be incoherent at times.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Politics
          <ul>
            <li>Might as well get this one out of the way.</li>
            <li>I hate talking about them with people publicly. It's kinda cringe.
                In private, yeah sure whatever that's cool. I know who I'm talking to.
                But there's no reason to sperg out on what you think is right or wrong.</li>
            <li>I try to stay apolitical in most <b>public</b> conversations, because no matter what you'll always have someone pissed off at you and somebody praising you.
                This isn't to say that I have been political in some conversations, but I try <i>not</i> to be political when possible and try to steer away from political conversations when I'm taking place in them.
                If I don't just leave the conversation as a whole.
                Seeing someone say "I support X and Y!" in a public chat and then watching it get flooded with "HOLY BASED" and "kill yourself, I'll explain why and how" gets boring after a while.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Social media
          <ul>
            <li><i>For reference and more understanding, I am going to define social media here as having the defining features of the current popular social media applications.
                This includes things like scores, likes/shares, ads, and being generally privacy invasive and FOSS-hostile.
                However, it is not limited to just those features and I have special exclusions for some services.
                I consider Discord a social media despite not having any of these features except the last two, but IRC and Matrix not.</i></li>
            <li>It is a cancer in our current society and I actively steer as far away as possible from it.</li>
            <li>But like a cancer, sometimes it shows up at my door and I gotta deal with it unwillingly. Sometimes it's hard to remove.</li>
            <li>Deleting most of my socials might've cost me a little bit on my friendships, but what I lose there I gain in sanity.</li>
            <li>It's not good when it's the first thing you see when you wake up and the last thing before bed.</li>
            <li>I am more than aware that I run a Discord server. I want to move away but won't for now, however my position as the Discord administrator might eventually be up for grabs.</li>
            <li>I have not used a social media service that has not left a sour taste in my mouth. All of them suck.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Piracy
          <ul>
            <li>It ain't stealing if you still have whatever I took.</li>
            <li>It is up to me on what to do with my copy of my files. I own them, <i>don't I?</i></li>
            <li>Copyright is kinda a meme anyway. Copyleft is where it's at.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>DRM
          <ul>
            <li>Wake me up when you figure out a reason for DRM besides "proving ownership", because with DRM you never actually own what you buy.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Streaming services
          <ul>
            <li>What's the point if I end up paying the same amount as cable when I get everything I want?</li>
            <li>I can't even watch the news unless I stack on the bundles!</li>
            <li>The only use for it is "watch it when you want, provided your internet is good and we have it licensed".
              I'll pirate it, thank you. I've had much better viewing experiences watching <code>Hackers.1996.1080p.WEB-DL.YIFY.mp4</code> than streaming it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Software
          <ul>
            <li>Free software is based and redpilled. Proprietary software is cringe and bluepilled.</li>
            <li>I currently run <i>almost</i> 100% free software on my computers.
              Notable exceptions are Discord, and the others are shitty web apps from Google. I have yet to pry myself away from the official YouTube website and onto Invidious.
              I do dual-boot Windows but the damn thing barely even runs on my <b>2016</b> (read: recent) laptop that came with Windows!
            </li>
            <li>Write simple software. Write a program to do one thing, and do it well. <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html">Read up on the UNIX philosophy. (HTTP)</a>
              I don't always follow these rules but I try to when I can.</li>
            <li>I will write a page on my current software stack eventually.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Web browsers
          <ul>
            <li>I only use Firefox because it isn't a derivative of Chromium. There is nothing viable that doesn't use some derivative of Chromium's engine anymore.</li>
            <li>Code should <b>not</b> be executed in the web browser. If your site doesn't work without JavaScript, make it work without it.
              I should not need JavaScript to read an article.
              If you're gonna write an app, suck it up and make it run natively instead of using a gimped Chromium build.</li>
            <li>Speaking about that, Electron is cringe. I don't need to run six (6) web browsers on my computer, I need one.
              Don't write code for a gimped web browser. Write it <b>natively</b>. I don't care if it's harder.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Music
          <ul>
            <li>Vaporwave is the real cyber pop. Hands down.
              <pre>-- 2021-07-16, /bpg/ Discord
&lt;trinity&gt; kpop accelerationism
&lt;trinity&gt; cyber pop
&lt;WeedSmokingJew&gt; the real cyber pop is vaporwave and all of it's subgenres
&lt;trinity&gt; idk if i agree</pre>
              This is cope. Cope harder.
            </li>
            <li>Modern pop music is trash.</li>
            <li>Modern country music is just <a href="https://ytb.trom.tf/watch?v=YWUQg0bqhVw">pandering</a> at this point. It's all bad.</li>
            <li>K-pop sucks. Someone put it as "anime 2.0", and I couldn't agree more.</li>
            <li>Sampling songs is cool as long as you actually make something derivative.
                Slowing it down and adding reverb and delay isn't derivative, it's lazy. Chopping it up, rearranging the song somewhat, along with slowing it down and reverb is much more preferable.</li>
            <li><a href="https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/album/--18">2814 - 新しい日の誕生 (Bandcamp)</a> is an album you should listen to if you like vaporwave.</li>
          </ul>
