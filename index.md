Hi, I program things in my free time and listen to an absurd amount of music.
I try to run as much free software as I can, and maintain a couple of projects
of my own.

You may find me in various dark and dusty corners of the Internet, usually under
the moniker Anonymous.

## Contact

You are free to contact me.
If I ignore you, don't fret.

I am currently going through a period of rapid exploration of the shoegaze genre.
