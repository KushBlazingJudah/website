Hi, I program things in my free time and listen to an absurd amount of music.
I try to run as much free software as I can, and maintain a couple of projects
of my own.

You may find me in various dark and dusty corners of the Internet, usually under
the moniker Anonymous.

## Contact

## What are you doing?

Last update: 2022-10-22

Still listening to shoegaze, and I still have a huge list of albums to listen
to.
Still playing Rimworld, albeit a bit less.

I've been focusing my attention elsewhere for the past little while, and will
continue doing so for some time, however I do have projects in the works.
They'll just take longer to finish.

Additionally, I'm trying to expand my horizons past Go.
Go has served me *extremely well*, but all of the projects I've written that
matter are written in Go.
Isn't it about time I shift gears into something else?

## Notable projects

- [boorumux](https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/boorumux): booru aggregator
- [feditext](https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/feditext): a federated textboard
- [uopds](https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/uopds): dead simple OPDS server

More to come eventually.
