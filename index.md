## What do you do?

I fish lobster and crab in the summer.
It's an alright job if you don't mind 4 AM mornings.
I do mind them which makes it slightly less of an alright job but I suffer through it.

I spend my spare time programming, playing games, listening to music, or learning something.

## What are you doing?

Still fishin'.
Drowning my sorrows in Arizona iced tea, there was a sale.
