Hi, I program things in my free time and listen to an absurd amount of music.
I try to run as much free software as I can, and maintain a couple of projects
of my own.

My favourite/most well known programming languages are Go and Lua, but I also
know bits and pieces of C and Python but consider myself a master of neither.
I work with POSIX sh, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript begrudgingly.

You may find me in various dark and dusty corners of the Internet, usually under
the moniker Anonymous.

## Contact

You are free to contact me.
If I ignore you, don't fret.
I either haven't gotten to it yet or I have other undisclosed reasons.

## What are you doing?

Last update: 2023-03-12

Alive, but focusing most my time elsewhere.

Due to the breakdown of the display assembly on my main laptop, a 2016 ASUS
Chromebook C202SA I bought off of a friend for $50 has become my main computer.

Working on a fork of FChannel in private, to be released soon.

## Notable projects

- [boorumux][ft] + [localbooru][lbru]: booru server/aggregator combo. WIP.
- fedichan (upcoming): federated imageboard, a continuation of [FChannel][fc]
- [feditext][ft]: a federated textboard
- [uopds][opds]: dead simple OPDS server. Abandoned.

More to come eventually, but know that these projects are just ones I don't
want to associate with my real name.
