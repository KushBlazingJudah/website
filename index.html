	<h2>What do you do?</h2>
	<p>
		I fish lobster and crab in the summer.
		It's an alright job if you don't mind 4 AM mornings.
		I do mind them which makes it slightly less of an alright job but I suffer through it.

		I spend my spare time programming, playing games, listening to music, or learning something.
	</p>

	<h2>What are you doing?</h2>
	<p>
		Last update: 2022-01-20
	</p>

	<p>
		Right now I am writing a IRC bouncer and client, neither are finished and the latter is being rewritten.
		Progress on both is slow as things are busy.
		Also forgetting to do Anki.
	</p>

	<h2>Notable projects</h2>
	<p>
		None public, as none are in working order enough to be public.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a half-baked IRC client and bouncer written in Go.
		The former is slowly being rewritten due to some awful design choices made during the client's birth.
		The latter also has design issues but nowhere near as bad.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have contributed a themes system to <a href="https://github.com/FChannel0/FChannel-Server">fchannel</a>, a federated imageboard.
		I have also worked on porting it to <a href="https://gofiber.io/">gofiber</a> but ran out of the continuous time chunks I needed.
		I hope to finish the port one day.
	</p>
	<p>
		I used to run /bpg/, a general on <a href="https://boards.4channel.org/g">/g/</a> for beginner programmers.
		I have since closed the project indefinitely.
		<br/>
		Total joins: 667. Total members before purge: 271. Most members: Around 350.
		Days survived: 405. Server born on 2020-12-11, closed 2022-01-20.
