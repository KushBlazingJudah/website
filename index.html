	<h2>What do you do?</h2>
	<p>
		I fish lobster and crab in the summer.
		It's an alright job if you don't mind 4 AM mornings.
		I do mind them which makes it slightly less of an alright job but I suffer through it.

		I spend my spare time programming, playing games, listening to music, or learning something.
	</p>

	<p>
		Right now I am writing a IRC bouncer and client, neither are finished and the latter is being rewritten.
		Progress on both is slow as things are busy however my bouncer is coming along quite well, maybe I can dogfood it soon.
		Another project I have on the go is setting up Gentoo on a dual-core laptop, sans OpenRC with runit in its place.
		More on this later maybe.
	</p>

	<h2>Notable projects</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/KushBlazingJudah/uopds">uopds</a>: a dead simple OPDS server.</li>
		</ul>

		More to come eventually.
		I have an IRC bouncer that's been in the works since forever due to several instances of "why did I ever think of implementing it like this".
		I have an IRC client that needs major refactoring.
