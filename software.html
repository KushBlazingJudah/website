		<h1>What do you use on your systems?</h1>
		<p>
			To put it simply, mostly GNU/Linux with some minimalist software.
		</p>

		<h2>On The Desktop</h2>
		<p>
			I use most of everything here everyday and my setup is "battle-tested" in a way.
			It's supposed to just work in almost any situation.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Desktop environment:</b> <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a>,
				<a href="https://tools.suckless.org/slock/">slock</a>, and a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwmblocks">Luke Smith's dwmblocks</a>.
				I may eventually release my build, but I might reconfigure it first since there's a lot of stuff in there I don't use anymore (including but not limited to gaps).
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Terminal emulator:</b> <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st/tree/73c034ba05101e2fc337183af1cdec5bfe318b99">This specific commit of Luke's st.</a>
				Newer versions of his build are very unstable on my system so I stopped using them and opted for the last commit without the changes that messed everything up.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Web browser:</b> Firefox
				<ul>
					<li>Unfortunately there aren't really any good web browsers that function as a solid alternative to anything most normal people would use,
						while being independent of both Firefox's and Chrome's codebase.
					<li><a href="https://www.netsurf-browser.org/">Netsurf</a> looks cool, and is usable, but I'm not going to use it as my main browser for now.
						My index doesn't render properly on it, which is no surprise as it uses CSS3 features to center the content, but otherwise looks good.</li>
					<li>I have chosen Firefox with a profile generated by a great tool called <a href="https://ffprofile.com">ffprofile</a>.</li>
					<li>It gets the job done, however I also have <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">lynx</a> installed on my machine.</li>
					<li>A select list of my Firefox addons:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff">Vimium</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin">uBlock Origin</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-redirect">Privacy Redirect</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes">LocalCDN</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/browserpass-ce">Browserpass</a></li>
							<li>There's more to this list, but muh fingerprinting.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Text editor:</b> <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a> (for text editing) and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> for development.
				I had to leave neovim for Emacs because neovim was simply becoming too slow even on a "bare minimum" setup that provides stuff you'd expect inside of an IDE.
				Emacs doesn't have these problems, so neovim has been downgraded to just a text editor now.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Music player:</b> <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">MPD</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp">ncmpcpp</a>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Video player:</b> <a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV</a>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Feed aggregator:</b> <a href="https://newsboat.org/">Newsboat</a>.
				I have been toying with <a href="https://codemadness.org/sfeed-simple-feed-parser.html">sfeed</a> recently too but I don't think I'll use it full-time.
				Cool project though.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Email:</b> I use <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith's</a> fantastic <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard">mutt-wizard.</a>
				It configures <a href="https://neomutt.org/">neomutt</a>, <a href="https://isync.sourceforge.io/">isync</a>, and <a href="https://notmuchmail.org/">notmuch</a>
				automatically with support for up to 9 accounts.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Password manager:</b> The only good one, <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>.
				Historically, I used gopass, which I don't recommend because it breaks compatibility with pass (you get GOPASS-SECRET-1.0 instead of passwords).
				I also used to use Bitwarden, which I can vouch for. Pretty good for normies.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>That's cool and all, but what about server-side?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>OS:</b> <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a>.
				Most of everything is managed with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>DNS:</b> <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>.
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>/bpg/ Services:</b> <a href="https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge">Matterbridge</a>, and my own Discord bot (source code available eventually)
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Also:</b> <a href="https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a>. Nice tool for IRC.
				TL;DR it connects to IRC for you and stays connected while you aren't.
			</li>
